    description: `At this level students can communicate in short conversations about familiar topics, though they may still pause while speaking. Their vocabulary is limited to everyday topics such as family, work, shopping, or hobbies. They can express basic opinions, describe simple experiences, and handle predictable situations in daily life. In reading, they can understand short, simple texts such as messages, personal letters, or brief articles on familiar topics. In writing, they can produce short paragraphs and simple connected sentences to describe events, people, or routines. Errors in grammar and spelling are still common, but the overall message is usually clear and understandable.`,
