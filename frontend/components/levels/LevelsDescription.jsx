              The CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) is an international
              standard that describes your ability to use English in real-life situations. It divides
              learners into different levels, from beginner to advanced, and helps you understand
              what you can already do and what you need to improve.
            </p>
            <p>
              At our website, each CEFR level includes lessons and practice activities designed to
              match your skills â€” so you can learn at your own pace, step by step. Whether you're just
              starting or preparing for advanced exams, you'll find materials that fit your level
              perfectly.
